> ### Radio Spectrum

Radio spectrum interface is used for setting up and adjusting satellite frequencies. There are two frequency ports at the moment - the first is used as downlink for satellite image and the second contains downlink frequency for [SAR Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar) as a part of [Future Imagery Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Imagery_Architecture) technology. The interface shows the status of system link, duplex emulation and processed signal.
